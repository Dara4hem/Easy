I lost my request setup twice during a debugging session, forcing me to reconfigure everything. The response timing is inconsistent, and the lack of built-in test assertions makes it unsuitable for automated validation.

Its environment variables and built-in JSON validation are solid for local testing workflows. I particularly appreciate the ability to quickly switch between staging and production endpoints. However, the lack of native CI/CD integration is a dealbreaker for our pipeline automation. While I can export collections and use the CLI tool, the process is clunky compared to Postman’s CI support. The UI is clean and intuitive, but for team-wide test automation, it falls short. Solid for individual debugging, but not enterprise-ready.", "created_at": "2025-12-06T18:14:22.929576", "source_model": "ollama:hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF:Q3_K_S", "quality": {"vocab_diversity": null, "semantic_novelty": null, "domain_realism": null, "bias_flags": [], "is_accepted": null}}
